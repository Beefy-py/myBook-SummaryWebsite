# myBook-SummaryWebsite
This is a website i created so my classmates can put their book summary on it. Here is a link: https://boekverslag2004.herokuapp.com/
So you can check out the source code. If there are any stuff you see that need a bit more sauce let me know on the
contact form on the website. I now there is a lot of redundant code there, especially on the app.py file and some of the templates.
